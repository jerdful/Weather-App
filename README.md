# weather-app
This is just a student project for a weather app.  The main title on the page is just a joke from an old show, if I were to actually use this app somewhere I would change it to something non-copyrighted of course.  

Some future updates for this app if I get time:

- Change the background image based on the result from each query, e.g. a sunny image for hot weather by adding a .css class
- add in an .api for google maps that shows a map location for the city in question
